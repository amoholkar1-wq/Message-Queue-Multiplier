# Message-Queue-Multiplier
This project uses System V message queues for inter-process communication between a server and three multiplier processes. The server coordinates sending values, receives multiplied results, filters duplicates, and outputs the smallest numbers of the form 2^a * 3^b * 5^c in sorted order efficiently.
